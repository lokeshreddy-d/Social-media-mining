I'll give you a text, act like an expert human annotator and determine if the given text falls under 'threat' or not. To understand what threat means, I am giving you description of it as well.

Threat: a statement of an intention to inflict pain, injury, damage, or other hostile action on someone in retribution for something done or not done

Please don't give any explanations or anything else rather than my given output format. Do not give an empty response.

Your response should be:
threat = 1 if the text is threat, or else 0
