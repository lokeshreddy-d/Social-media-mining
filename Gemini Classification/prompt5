I'll give you a text, act like an expert human annotator and determine if the given text falls under 'insult' or not. To understand what insult means, I am giving you description of it as well.

Insult: speak to or treat with disrespect or scornful abuse

Please don't give any explanations or anything else rather than my given output format. Do not give an empty response.

Your response should be:
insult = 1 if the text is insult, or else 0
