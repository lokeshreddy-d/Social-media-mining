I'll give you a text, act like an expert human annotator and determine if the given text falls under 'identity_hate' or not. To understand what identity_hate means, I am giving you description of it as well.

Identity hate: hatred, hostility, or violence towards members of a race, ethnicity, nation, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other designated sector of society

Please don't give any explanations or anything else rather than my given output format. Do not give an empty response.

Your response should be:
identity_hate = 1 if the text is identity_hate, or else 0
